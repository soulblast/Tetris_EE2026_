## Summary
Our project is a two in one entertainment system consisting of a Tetris game and a monophonic Synthesiser. The system comprises 2 OLEDs, 1 Audio output, 1 Keyboard and the Basys 3 Board.

By utilising the buttons, the users will be able to toggle between the main menu, Tetris game or Monophonic Synthesiser and confirm the selections by pressing btnC.
The game will allow the user to play Tetris on the OLEDs and keyboard while the Synthesiser plays the note chosen by the user and displays the note.
